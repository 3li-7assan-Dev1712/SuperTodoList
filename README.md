<h1>Super Todo List App</h1>
The reason that I call this app super is because that the app demonstrates the clean code architecture and all the android development best practices, following the MVVM architecture and the principle of the separation of concerns (let's talk a little bit about such a principle, it means that the fragments are just responsible for displaying the data and all the business logic will be delegated to ViewModel). This process has a great impact of the application functionality such like handling the configuration changes, and process death.
<h2>Demonstrated Tools</h2>
- Architecture components </br>
- Kotlin coroutines and flow</br>
- view biding</br>
- MVVM architecture (ViewModel & LiveData & Flow)</br>
- Navigation Components</br>
- Dependency Injection with Dagger2/Hilt</br>
