<h1>Super Todo List App</h1>
The reason that I call this app super is because the app demonstrate the clean code architecture
and all the android development best practise, following the MVVM architecture and the principle of
the separation of concerns (let's talk a little bit about such a principle, it means
that the fragments is just responsible for displaying the data and all the business logic will be
delegated to ViewModel). This process have a great impact of the application functionality such like
handling the configuration changes, and process death.
<h2>Demonstrated Tools</h2>
- Architecture components </br>
- Kotlin coroutines and flow</br>
- view biding</br>
- MVVM architecture (ViewModel & LiveData & Flow)</br>
- Navigation Components</br>
- Dependency Injection with Dagger2/Hilt</br>
